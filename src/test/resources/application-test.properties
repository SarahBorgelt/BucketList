# This specifies the JDBC URL for the H2 database:

#jdbc:h2:mem:testdb creates an in-memory database named testdb. It only exists while the application is running
#DB_CLOSE_DELAY=-1 keeps the in-memory databse alive as long as the JVM runs, even if all connections are closed
#DB_CLOSE_ON_EXIT=FALSE prevents H2 from closing the database automatically when the JVM exits
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:h2:mem:testdb;DB_CLOSE_DELAY=-1;DB_CLOSE_ON_EXIT=FALSE

#This tells Spring Boot which JDBC driver to use to connect to H2
spring.datasource.driverClassName=org.h2.Driver

#This is the username & password for connecting to the database connection
spring.datasource.username=postgres
spring.datasource.password=postgres1

#This tells Hibernate which SQL dialect to use for generating queries. While H2 has a slightly different SQL
#syntax than PostgreSQL, H2Dialect ensures Hibernate generates compatible SQL
spring.jpa.database-platform=org.hibernate.dialect.H2Dialect

#This controls how Hibernate handles database schema on application start/stop
#create-drop creates tables when the app starts and drops them when it shuts down
spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=create-drop

#This tells Hibernate to log all SQL queries it generates to the console, which is helpful for debugging
spring.jpa.show-sql=true
